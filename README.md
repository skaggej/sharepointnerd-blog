Custom Turing test for SP2010 blog comments
<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br />This is a sandboxed solution for a hosted SharePoint 2010 website to which the admin has no server access. I built this to prevent spam comments on my blog. This solution deploys an Event Receiver that fires on the ItemAdding event for the Comments list and validates the comment.</p>
